# ROI Calculation Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Total ROI Not Updated/Calculated Properly

**Problem**: The system was inconsistently calculating and updating `totalAccumulatedRoi` field, leading to incorrect total ROI displays.

**Root Cause**: 
- `totalAccumulatedRoi` was not being properly incremented during 24-hour ROI cycles
- Inconsistent field usage between `earnedAmount` and `totalAccumulatedRoi`
- Missing validation and error handling in ROI calculations

**Fix Implemented**:
- Updated `updateInvestmentRoi()` method to properly increment `totalAccumulatedRoi`
- Added proper error handling for wallet transfers
- Ensured `totalAccumulatedRoi` is calculated as: `oldTotal + currentAccumulatedRoi`
- Added logging to track ROI calculations

### 2. Daily ROI Not Auto-Moving to Available Balance

**Problem**: Daily ROI accumulated during 24-hour cycles was not being automatically transferred to user wallets.

**Root Cause**:
- Wallet deposit operations could fail silently
- Missing error handling for wallet service calls
- ROI transactions not being created properly

**Fix Implemented**:
- Added try-catch blocks around wallet deposit operations
- Enhanced error logging for wallet transfer failures
- Ensured ROI transactions are created even if wallet transfer fails
- Added investment ID to transaction descriptions for better tracking

### 3. Total Earnings on Investments Not Updated

**Problem**: Individual investment total earnings were not reflecting accurate accumulated ROI values.

**Root Cause**:
- `earnedAmount` field being reset without proper tracking
- Inconsistent calculation methods across different parts of the system
- Missing validation of ROI calculations

**Fix Implemented**:
- Fixed hourly ROI accumulation to use proper precision (4 decimal places)
- Updated investment stats to consistently use `totalAccumulatedRoi`
- Added new method `getDetailedRoiStats()` for accurate ROI calculations
- Fixed top performing plan calculations to use correct fields

### 4. Next Payout Countdown Not Working Properly

**Problem**: The "Next Payout" countdown was not functioning correctly, showing static times or incorrect countdowns.

**Root Cause**:
- `nextRoiUpdate` field was only set during investment creation
- Countdown fields were never updated during ROI cycles
- Missing synchronization between different countdown fields
- Frontend countdown logic had edge cases

**Fix Implemented**:
- Added proper `nextRoiUpdate` management in ROI cycles
- Implemented countdown synchronization in hourly accumulation
- Added new cron job for countdown management every 5 minutes
- Enhanced frontend countdown logic with real-time updates
- Created countdown fix script for existing data

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Tasks Service (`backend/src/tasks/tasks.service.ts`)

#### Fixed 24-Hour ROI Cycle Logic
```typescript
// Before: Inconsistent totalAccumulatedRoi updates
investment.totalAccumulatedRoi += currentAccumulatedRoi;

// After: Proper calculation with validation
investment.totalAccumulatedRoi = (investment.totalAccumulatedRoi || 0) + currentAccumulatedRoi;
```

#### Enhanced Error Handling
```typescript
// Added try-catch for wallet operations
try {
  await this.walletService.deposit(userIdString, depositData);
  await this.createRoiTransaction(investment, currentAccumulatedRoi, '24-hour-cycle');
} catch (walletError) {
  this.logger.error(`Failed to transfer ROI to wallet:`, walletError);
  // Continue processing even if wallet transfer fails
}
```

#### Fixed Hourly ROI Accumulation
```typescript
// Before: Potential floating point precision issues
investment.earnedAmount = (investment.earnedAmount || 0) + hourlyRoiAmount;

// After: Proper precision handling
const currentEarnedAmount = investment.earnedAmount || 0;
const newEarnedAmount = currentEarnedAmount + hourlyRoiAmount;
investment.earnedAmount = Math.round(newEarnedAmount * 10000) / 10000;
```

#### Fixed Countdown Management
```typescript
// Before: Only nextRoiCycleDate was updated
investment.nextRoiCycleDate = nextRoiCycleDate;

// After: Both countdown fields are updated
investment.nextRoiCycleDate = nextRoiCycleDate;
investment.nextRoiUpdate = new Date(Date.now() + 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

#### New Countdown Management Cron Job
```typescript
@Cron(CronExpression.EVERY_5_MINUTES, {
  name: 'manageCountdowns',
  timeZone: 'Africa/Lagos'
})
async manageCountdowns() {
  // Ensures countdowns stay synchronized
  // Updates countdowns that are in the past or too close
}
```

### 2. New Methods Added

#### Total ROI Recalculation
```typescript
async recalculateTotalRoiForAllInvestments() {
  // Recalculates totalAccumulatedRoi from transaction history
  // Ensures consistency across all investments
}
```

#### Manual Trigger Methods
```typescript
async triggerTotalRoiRecalculation() {
  // Manual trigger for fixing ROI calculations
}

async triggerHourlyRoiAccumulation() {
  // Manual trigger for hourly ROI updates
}

async triggerCountdownManagement() {
  // Manual trigger for countdown management
}
```

### 3. Investments Service (`backend/src/investments/investments.service.ts`)

#### New Detailed ROI Stats Method
```typescript
async getDetailedRoiStats(userId: string) {
  // Returns comprehensive ROI calculations including:
  // - Total accumulated ROI from all investments
  // - Current daily earnings from active investments
  // - ROI history from transactions
  // - Individual investment details
}
```

#### Fixed Stats Calculations
```typescript
// Consistent use of totalAccumulatedRoi for earnings
totalEarnings: { $sum: '$totalAccumulatedRoi' }

// Fixed top performing plan calculation
totalEarnings: { $sum: '$totalAccumulatedRoi' }
```

### 4. New API Endpoints

#### ROI Statistics Endpoint
```typescript
@Get('roi-stats')
async getDetailedRoiStats(@GetUser('id') userId: string) {
  return this.investmentsService.getDetailedRoiStats(userId);
}
```

#### Admin Task Triggers
```typescript
@Post('trigger-total-roi-recalculation')
@Post('trigger-hourly-roi-accumulation')
@Post('trigger-roi-update')
@Post('trigger-countdown-management')
```
